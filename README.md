# Analyzing-Traffic-Data-SQL
 We aim to analyze the origin of the majority of our website sessions,
 as we begin to generate sales. Our goal is to gain insights into the
 specific UTM sources, campaigns, and referring domains that are
 driving traffic to our website. This analysis covers the period up 
 until 2012-04-12, allowing us to obtain a comprehensive breakdown 
 of these factors
 
 ## Task 1
 We have begun to generate sales and now we would like to gain insight
 into the primary sources of our website sessions up until yesterday. 
 It would greatly benefit us to analyze the distribution based on **UTM
 source**, **campaign**, and **referring domain**.
 
 ### Task 1, results:

It appears that a significant portion of our website traffic originates
 from **nonbrand** searches on **gsearch**. However, it is crucial for us to
 determine whether these browsing sessions are ultimately leading to sales.
